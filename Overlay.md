## Live image from camera
`PSAT-2 +69605 8°C #062 89lx1`
* `+69605` timestamp - minutes elapsed since reboot
* `8°C` MCU temperature when taking the image
* `#062` counter of camera snapshots
* `89lx1` light when taking the image, mantisa and exponent in lux, i.e. 89*10^1 = 890lux
* Timestamp, temperature and light are actual.
* Note: Light exposition seems to be too low - sensor was probably misplaced during satellite integration.
